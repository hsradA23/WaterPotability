# WaterPotability Measure

This is a small wrapper application that has a frontend written in svelte, and a backend made with NodeJS.

The backend calls a [Machine Learning model](https://github.com/MegaBeing/WaterPotability/blob/master/water_potability.ipynb), that allows us to 
categorise the given water sample as potable or otherwise.
